transactions within a library. The system will provide functionalities for librarians to add
new books, manage borrower information, issue and return books, and generate reports.

to perform CRUD operations on books and borrowers, as well as issue and return books.

mapping (ORM) framework. Interns will deepen their understanding of object-oriented
programming (OOP) principles, database interactions, and GUI development while
implementing a real-world application in Java.
Skills Required: Intermediate Java programming, understanding of object-oriented
principles.
