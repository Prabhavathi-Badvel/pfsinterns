Create a simple student record management system to store and manage information
such as student names, roll numbers, and grades. The system will allow users to add
new student records, view existing records, update information, and delete records as

needed. The completed project should be a console-based application featuring a menu-
driven interface for performing CRUD operations on student records. Data should be

stored persistently using file handling techniques, and basic validation should be
implemented to ensure data integrity. Interns will learn about file handling in Java,
including reading from and writing to text files, as well as implementing CRUD operations
in a console-based application.
Skills Required: Basic Java programming, understanding of file handling.

Completed the Task using :

-Spring MVC for the web framework, incorporating model, service, controller, and repository classes
-Java for the backend logic
-MySQL for the database management
